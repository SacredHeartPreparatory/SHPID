# SHPID

SHPID Is a system to manage the Student ID Cards for students at Sacred Heart Schools, Atherton.
Student IDs, attached to a barcode, are used by the school for the purchase of food in the cafeteria (tied to an epicurean account), 
the checking out of books in the library, the entrance into school functions, and more. Much of student 
life is controlled by each studentâ€™s unique Student ID and its card. 
To prevent students from not having the card, SHPID allows students to use their card on their mobile phone in a secure,
convenient, and fast way. 

SHPID Card is available on the iOS app store here <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shp-id-card/id1014110287?mt=8">here.</a>
